# Juom
Juom is a fullstack web framework built on Java and Javascript. Juom ditches the traditional MVC model by letting each page handle their own requests. Juom also allows for universal objects to be traded between the frontend and backend, along with their functionality. Juom also has support for server-side rendering.
